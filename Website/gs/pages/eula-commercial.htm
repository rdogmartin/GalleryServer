		is transferred to the party designated in the agreement between TECH INFO SYSTEMS
		and the user. You may not distribute or redistribute changes made to the Software
		Product to anyone other than groups designated by the agreement between TECH INFO
		SYSTEMS and the user. Contact TECH INFO SYSTEMS using the information included at
